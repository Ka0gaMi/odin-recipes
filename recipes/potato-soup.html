    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>I have made this potato soup for many whom have given it this title. It takes a bit of effort but is well worth it. Please note: for those who do not wish to use bacon, substitute 1/4 cup melted butter for the bacon grease and continue with the recipe. (I generally serve this soup as a special treat as it is not recommended for people counting calories.)</p>
    <p>A bowl of this ultra-comforting potato soup will please everyone at your table.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>1 pond bacon, chopped</li>
        <li>2 stalks celery, diced</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>8 potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken stock</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried tarragon</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cook the bacon.</li>
            <p>Cook bacon in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until brown and crispy. Drain bacon on paper towels and drain most (but not all!) of the bacon grease.</p>
        <li>Cook the Soup</li>
            <p>Cook the celery, onion, and garlic in the remaining bacon grease. Add cubed potatoes and toss with veggies. Return the bacon to the pan and cover all the ingredients with chicken stock. Cover and simmer until the potatoes are tender.</p>
            <p>In a separate skillet, whisk butter into melted flour until slightly thickened. Whisk in heavy cream, tarragon, and cilantro. Bring the mixture to a boil and cook until thick and creamy.</p>
            <p>Stir cream mixture into potato mixture.</p>
        <li>Blend and Serve</li>
            <p>Transfer half of the soup to a blender and puree, then return to the Dutch oven. Season to taste and serve with your favorite toppings, such as crumbled bacon or shredded Cheddar cheese.</p>
    </ul>
