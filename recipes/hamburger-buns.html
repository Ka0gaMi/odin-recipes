    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>These soft hamburger buns are perfect for burgers, pulled pork, or your favorite sandwich filling. I've gotten a thousand requests for these! Not only are these the perfect shape, but they taste way better than anything that comes out of a plastic bag. The total time takes almost 4 hours, but the actual amount of work involved is maybe 10 minutes.</p>
    <p>Sure, you could buy hamburger buns at the grocery store â€” but where's the fun in that? It's easier than you think to make homemade hamburger buns, and they're way more delicious than the store-bought alternative.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 package active dry yeast.</li>
        <li>1 pound all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, divided</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/4 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the Dough</strong></li>
            <p>Begin by proofing the yeast with some of the flour. Once the yeast is foamy, add the remaining flour, an egg, butter, sugar, and salt. Fit a stand mixer with a dough hook and knead the dough, scraping the sides often, until it's soft and sticky.</p>
        <li><strong>Let the Dough Rise</strong></li>
            <p>Transfer the dough to a floured surface and form into a smooth, round ball. Tuck the ends underneath and return the dough to an oil-drizzled stand mixer bowl. Ensure the dough is coated with oil, then cover and allow to rise in a warm place until it has doubled in size.</p>
        <li><strong>Form the Buns</strong></li>
            <p>Transfer the dough back to the floured work surface. Pat into a slightly rounded rectangle, then cut into eight equal squares. Use your hands to shape and pat the squares into discs. Arrange the buns on a floured baking sheet, cover, and let rise until they've doubled in size.</p>
        <li><strong>Bake the Buns</strong></li>
            <p>Brush the buns with an egg wash and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake in a preheated oven until lightly browned. Remove from the oven, allow the buns to cool, and slice in half lengthwise to serve.</p>
    </ol>
